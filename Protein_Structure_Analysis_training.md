__NOTOC__ Analyzing the protein structure of your
protein-of-interest can be advantageous in multiple ways. It can help
you discover regions which are good candidates to interact with other
proteins. It can help you discover new domains. It can help with
identifying differences with homologuous proteins and a lot more.

## Setting up the tools

Everything should be set up and installed for you already for the
training session. So this section is only here if there is real trouble
or you want to set Yasara and FoldX up at home.
